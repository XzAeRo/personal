\tab a I am writing to confirm my interest in a full-time position at Spotify in a software engineering role. My name is Adam James-Liebau Johnson, and I am going to be a new grad from the University of Michigan College of Engineering's Computer Science program. I found this position by searching the Spotify careers page for roles that interested me and fit my skillset, because I believe in the Spotify product and I have a strong interest in relocating to Scandinavia. I believe that I am qualified for this role, and that I can contribute much to the quality and success of Spotify.

\tab a In May 2016, I will have completed my University education, earning a degree from University of Michigan with a major in Computer Science. The courses I have taken and am currently taking have prepared me to be a strong contributor at Spotify. Specifically, EECS 445: Machine Learning, EECS 485: Web Databases and Information Systems, EECS 482: Operating Systems, and the general algorithms and data structures courses all teach material directly relevant to Spotify's engineering department. Machine Learning for music recommendations, targeted advertising, and general data analysis; Web Databases for TCP/IP, HTTP, and other web technologies and protocols on both the frontend and backend that enable Spotify to deliver music to consumers; and Operating Systems prepared me for development of complex, performant systems with intelligent use of caching, concurrency, and parallelism. In addition to my University coursework, I have four summers worth of industry experience in internships, mostly on web technologies from backend to frontend. 

\tab a This letter should be accompanied by my resume in the application you received. I would very much love to work for Spotify AB in Sweden because I believe that the technologies used and problems encountered are a good fit for both my professional interest and experience. I can be reached at my email address, ajlj@umich.edu for any follow-up if Spotify is interested in arranging an interview.
